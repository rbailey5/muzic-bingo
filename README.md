# MUZIC Bingo Card Generator

A simple web based tool for created cards for the amazing game of MUZIC Bingo.

## How-To Guide

1. Select a properly arranged CSV file
2. Choose how many cards you'd like to create
3. (Optional) Change the generator settings
4.  Generate the selected amount of cards
5. Print your fancy new MUZIC Bingo cards

## Tips

- Make sure the selected CSV is formatted correctly.
	- Artist comma Song then a line break afterwards. 
	- In excel that would be column A with Artists and column B with Songs
- Try to leave out unnecessary punctuation such as quotation marks.
- Check your Artists and Song names for duplicates and consistency
- Naming an Artist or Song as "NA" will cause it to not appear if the "Hide Artists Or Titles Marked AsÂ _"NA"_" Checkbox is checked.
- Cards shown on the webpage are simply previews of the layouts.
	- The printed cards will have more styling, and will adjuct to any size paper they are printed on.

## Future Plans

- Better organized and managed code.
- Option to add a logo instead of the word "FREE" in the free space.
- Option to trim text that is too long.
- Check for titles or artists who's names may be too long.
- Option to directly input CSV data via text box if no CSV file exists.
- Nicer solution than using "NA".
